# Customer Loyalty App

## Overview

A new start up is looking for a way to reward their customers for purchases over time. They are asking for a customer loyalty application that they can use to send out rewards to customers after a certain number of purchases. Their ideal app would be something that a customer could have on their phone to present at time of purchase.

## Business Rules

- The company should be able to add promotions (a promotion would be something like 'Buy 10 smoothies and the 11th is free')
- Customers need to be able to signup (opt in) to the application
- Customers are automatically eligiable to recieve purchase credit towards any promotions being offered
- The company needs to be able to track when a customer makes a qualified purchase and apply it to the customer account
- Customers need to be able to see their purchase tracker so they know how many have been made for a given promotion
- Customers cannot alter their purchase tracker. It must be read only
- Purchase tracker (virtual puch card) must be able to be reset once the customer redeems it
- The company wants to keep all records to see who their most loyal customers are
